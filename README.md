# Multiple_Linear_Regression

By the end of this project, anyone will be able to:

* Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn
* Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE
* Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
